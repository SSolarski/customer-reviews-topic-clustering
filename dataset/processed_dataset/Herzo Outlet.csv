147,1045,False,2024,For me it only gives 1 star because you were turned away very unpleasantly at the entrance because of a small dog that was sitting in a dog cart.

155,733,True,2023,There are very attractive offers. The selection is huge. The staff to ask questions was few and far between and apparently not particularly motivated. I'd better not comment on the snack stand in the entrance area.

384,592,True,2023,"Very clearly laid out, nice staff who help straight away. The most important thing, of course, is that there are also many offers on site. Thanks"
385,561,True,2023,"A large selection, but also a lot of people, queues at the checkouts, selected sizes for clothes"
386,742,True,2023,"Fewer and fewer real offers, mainly terrible colors, designs and sizes, I don't go there anymore. With a 90km journey it's not worth it, two offers for one.
P.S. In addition, the A3 motorway is an imposition."
387,448,False,2023,"Well mediocre, way too full. Service not particularly friendly"
388,884,False,2024,Pretty crazy! You have to search a lot!
389,243,True,2023,I always enjoy going there.
390,607,False,2023,"Very nice outlet with sizes for everyone. It's constantly being replenished here. Very good bargains possible, but you need time. The only annoyance is that the cash registers are often sparsely staffed."
391,444,False,2023,The employee at the checkout was really not communicative. We had a question about our account and she had no idea. A pity. Otherwise a great outlet. Prices can occasionally be found cheaper elsewhere.
392,633,True,2023,"Very confusingly laid out. Very nice advice, you just have to look for it. Prices not particularly cheap."
393,68,True,2022,"The queue is tough, with a mask only ffp2-3"
394,764,True,2023,"As always, very neat and structured. This time it wasn't very crowded, which made browsing easier. …"
395,573,True,2023,Everyone will find something for themselves and at a reasonable price
396,262,True,2023,Very good offers like every last Saturday of the month they give you 20% more discount on the outlet price because it is a bargain and worth waiting in line at the ATMs😁 …
397,436,False,2023,"This is spectacular in the store, the Adidas outlet is so big, I have already visited it 3 times, and I always find a piece of clothing or sneakers"
398,354,True,2021,"My first experience and I absolutely love it! The 200km were definitely worth it!
It was rare that the right size wasn't available. Despite the amount of people. Very clean and clear."
399,383,True,2023,Great outlet! It's always worth a detour. You can even save extra with the running app and the points you earn. Great.
400,417,True,2023,"Good parking on site, the shop is well equipped and has friendly staff. However, it is sometimes very crowded on weekends"
401,174,False,2023,"As always with an outlet like this, you can sometimes find something more or less suitable. This outlet used to have a bit more of the charm of an actual warehouse sale and factory sale atmosphere. But that has become increasingly less of a …"
402,1043,True,2023,Price performance is awesome.
403,1065,False,2023,"There are a lot of goods, but mostly small sizes, L, XL, very few sizes, good discounts!"
404,431,True,2023,Unfortunately I was very dissatisfied. Outlet extremely small for my taste and no good offers. There are better offers online. Unfortunately for me the journey was completely unnecessary.
405,219,True,2023,Always good for a bargain.
406,468,True,2023,"Way too expensive.
I can get this cheaper at Zalando"
407,938,True,2023,Were there because of football shoes - very good selection and offers
408,115,False,2023,"Incredibly, it used to be possible to exchange your shoes months later. And these days not even the next day, even though the shoes caused 3 blisters on the first day."
409,85,True,2023,"Lots of choice, but unfortunately most of the common sizes were no longer in stock. You would probably have to have more time for the big bargains."
410,255,False,2023,"Lots of running clothes and football stuff. Lots of Adidas shoes in ugly colors and models that you can get online for a better price. Little streetwear. And if so, the price is rather bad. From the outside it looks like it's worth it... But once you're in the Adidas outlet you quickly realize that it's not really worth it."
411,839,True,2023,"Large selection, great prices.
Unfortunately some sports are not represented, therefore only 4 stars."
412,724,True,2023,"Crazy cheap clothes and shoes!! We found shoes here for €20 by accident. The shoes were not marked cheap or on sale in any way! The adidas set for the lady here cost €49 (sweatshirt with sweatpants). Well, just real clothes and no inflated prices"
413,794,False,2023,Always great for a bargain
414,460,True,2023,There are just things that other people don't want to buy
415,330,True,2022,Beautifully made shopping stamp. The staff friendly and helpful. I was disappointed by the scope of the offer. The same pants that I bought in Wertheim last week were €10 more expensive here - €45 instead of €35. The good old Handball …
416,1009,True,2023,The building itself is really great. And there is also a huge selection. But that has nothing to do with an outlet. We drove 2 hours to get great bargains. But the prices are like in any Karstadt or other stores. There was Adidas at Aldi on Saturday. Those were outlet prices ;-)
417,994,False,2023,"- great offers,
- nice personel
- very tidy …"
418,805,True,2023,"I bought a pair of training pants.
At home I noticed that there were three large holes in the pants (probably caused by the fuse). …"
419,605,False,2023,"Not what it used to be. Formerly a factory outlet, now a normal outlet store. Far too few bargains."
420,132,True,2023,"I'm still laughing at the price of a pair of (ordinary for me) sweatpants: 40% off!!! Instead of, please hold on, €140, only €100!!!!!!!"
421,396,True,2023,"Actually, for me Adidas is a sports brand. But those days are probably over.
Lifestyle, lifestyle, streetwear...
There is nothing left for tennis. You can save yourself all the advertising with …"
422,606,True,2022,"Unfortunately it's no longer what it was a few years ago.
We used to always find what we were looking for here, but unfortunately the selection is dwindling. Unfortunately, the last few times we had to leave the store quickly because there was nothing left that was suitable for us."
423,510,True,2020,"Huge store, good selection and great prices! Worth a visit! Loaction is also mega👍🏼 …"
424,310,True,2021,"Not what it used to be.
You'll sometimes look in vain for outlet prices here (my sports shop around the corner has the same products, sometimes at cheaper prices). In addition, it is …"
425,956,True,2023,Not a big discount in my opinion
426,375,False,2023,Good goods and good prices
427,145,False,2023,"Well, it sounds stupid, but it used to be better. We didn't find anything here. Just standard, nothing special. And prices are also quite high. But Puma and Nike are good, it's worth looking through them."
428,128,False,2023,"Great, a kingdom of shoes"
429,895,True,2023,It's very great there
430,270,True,2023,Always worth a visit.
431,872,True,2023,"No help with the purchase and no selection, you go to the manufacturer just to see a few shoes in your size, but they are too narrow"
432,34,True,2023,Very large selection!
433,1018,True,2023,"Adidas it's easy. Top selection and great advice. The salespeople are professional, nice and know what they are talking about.
More is not possible."
434,459,True,2022,"Items are marked at the wrong (cheaper) price, exactly the same price as in normal stores. Not recommended, the offer also left a lot to be desired as common sizes were out of stock, all for a 1 hour wait."
435,518,True,2023,Unfortunately there wasn't much new
436,881,True,2023,The shoes there were fine. The employees there were very friendly except for one who complained to me because a pair of pants that didn't belong to me were on the floor and I didn't pick them up. There are a lot of soccer shoes there at a very reduced discount.
437,486,False,2023,"Shirt bought on May 15th
Washed and printing sometimes felt like I called 20 times
Washed at 30 degrees and turned inside out, no response from adidas
Once adidas left adidas 400 euros there for the last time, never again"
438,702,False,2023,"Only small sizes, nothing stunning in the normal shop! Unfortunately...."
439,142,True,2023,"A bit disappointed. I went to both stores, but neither had the ""Tennis Hu Shoes"". I live 20 minutes from Adidas City and now have to order online."
440,976,True,2023,"Selection and price/performance ratio more than disappointing. Not worth going there. You're not allowed in with a dog, but at Nike you are. Never again!!!"
441,788,False,2023,A mega selection of clothing and shoes...really top...great advice everywhere...definitely worth it.
442,626,True,2023,"Saturday
Bulk shopping day

446,558,False,2024,Everything your heart desires is there
447,422,True,2023,"Wrong price information, when I asked I was told it was incorrectly priced. Unfortunately, they can't sell the shoe at this price.
It's just strange that 5 more pairs were wrongly awarded again a week later."
448,367,False,2023,Not really worth it. Too expensive and no bargains. Coffee closes at 4 p.m. Incredible! Toilets dirty.
449,427,True,2023,"Shopping is great if you know what you want and need. Of course there is no advice here, but everyone should know that for themselves beforehand."
450,875,True,2023,"I had hoped for more... more selection (women's running), more sizes in the medium range (S, M), more outlet prices... What a shame! Positive to mention: it is tidy and has a nice atmosphere."

452,883,True,2023,"Many options
Action weeks like this wouldn't be bad"
453,156,False,2023,The employees in the cafeteria seem completely overwhelmed and take it out on the customers. Unable to be surpassed in terms of unfriendliness!!!
454,24,True,2023,A nice and clear store. Real bargains were rare.
455,1014,True,2023,"I must come here every time I go on a business trip, the discount is huge, and you can get an additional 20% off at checkout."
456,634,True,2023,"Not just in the outlet, but also in the flagship store. Both found what they were looking for.
The outlet was better, but it's just an outlet. Hit up when you're there"

462,851,False,2023,I'm a little disappointed in the tiny running clothing department for men. .. and then only XS or XL of what I wanted.
463,541,True,2023,"A top shop over 2 floors full of offers. If you need something about sports, you'll find it. Unless you're into Adidas. You have to see it once."
464,129,True,2022,"Large store with a wide selection.
There is a star deduction because most items are only reduced by 20-30% from the original price. After a long search, however, we got some great snaps (50-70% of the original price) and went home satisfied."
465,202,True,2022,"Sometimes things are very cheap, but not always. You have to shop carefully before you buy something, rather compare prices online."
466,269,True,2024,There are a few bargains there.

470,744,False,2023,We unknowingly went to the Outet Store with our little 2.5 kg Maltese lightly under our arm (the dog doesn't lose any hair and is absolutely clean). After a short time we were intercepted and literally thrown out of the store. An absolute no-go thanks to adidas for their customer unfriendliness.
471,170,True,2023,"There would be lots of nice things to buy. However, rarely in my size.
There's far too little for tall people and especially nothing for people with big feet."
472,611,True,2018,"Every now and then you find something here and can save yourself a few thalers. However, you should be aware that many things are not 50% cheaper than in normal stores. Long journeys are therefore not worth it."
473,817,True,2023,Not as cheap as expected. My sizes for shoes and shirts were often already sold out.
474,58,True,2023,Large sizes are hard to find here. Prices are not really cheap.

478,924,False,2023,"Large selection. In the end the same prices as in any other outlet center. No real bargains. I can also look at the sale in the online shop. In addition, only 3 cash registers are open. After 10 minutes in line for a bucket hat, I left the goods and left. Service almost zero. Sorry Adidas"

487,813,True,2023,Strange people who are overwhelmed by the size and there is hardly anything that you can't get online or in other stores. For the same price.
488,1041,True,2023,Great factory outlet right next to Adidas headquarters with a very large selection and great prices. Shopping here becomes an experience.

490,722,True,2022,"Finally shopping again without a long wait. As always, there was a large selection of bargains. For example, superstars for 35 euros, sold out by Reebok and there were 3 face masks for free at the checkout."
491,292,True,2021,"A very pleasant place to shop cheaply. A huge selection and friendly staff make shopping in this modern outlet store a pleasure. Likewise, of course, the extremely affordable prices. Great!"
492,249,True,2023,"A great place for lovers of the adidas brand, shoes, tracksuits, T-shirts8 and many, many other things related to the brand."

495,164,True,2023,"Large selection, good prices, nice staff!"
496,550,True,2023,As bad as Ikea on a Saturday. Mostly standard parts and the prices aren't overwhelmingly lower than retail. And the toilets look like they've been at a district league B promotion celebration.

504,414,False,2016,"Do you penny pinchers want everything for free? And yet the current collection is on the first floor, but not everyone can get in there. I have only had positive experiences with the outlet. The price-performance ratio is optimal."
505,921,False,2021,"Long line in front of the building! About 40 minutes later we went in! Great selection, friendly and helpful staff. But the hygiene concept, sorry, didn't really exist here! And no one here seems to care! Finding bargains (and leaving them …"

529,637,True,2023,A “must have” on the way back from the Alps. Nice and cheap...
530,728,True,2023,Fun for the whole family on 2 floors. There is free water and a little something to eat downstairs. Beach loungers outside to relax.
531,716,True,2020,"Unfortunately it only has a bazaar character. You're just pushed through... Unfriendly staff... And the ""best thing"": Shoes are tied together with a plastic lock and can't be tried on and tried out individually! The supposed bargain prices don't make up for that either..."
532,627,True,2018,"I expected more. If you have normal clothing sizes, most things are already out of stock or cut strangely. However, you can get a bargain on clothes that don't have to fit properly (short jogging pants, socks, flip flops)."
533,239,True,2019,"the size is impressive, the range is correspondingly large - but you have to look for the really cheap prices and be careful not to pay too much; However, the employees are usually unmotivated and the friendliness has potential to improve"

538,506,False,2022,"Sometimes more expensive than in regular shops... No samples or remaining stock like before in Dassler Strasse... Above all, no more quality... Where has the good old Made in Germany gone??? No revival of what used to be million-sellers... Sad company..."
539,477,True,2021,"Long queues in front of the store. That's why I'm not pure.
But I have found in the past that the prices are not worthy of an outlet.
This used to be different when it was still a real factory outlet. Back then, the long journey was worth it."
540,926,True,2016,Way too expensive. Shoes usually cost €85 online and €75 in the outlet... I prefer to order from home and save myself the journey. From an outlet I expect at least 50% discount on the regular market price and not a ridiculous discount of …

549,32,True,2019,"Parking options are plentiful and the parking garage is free and clear.
