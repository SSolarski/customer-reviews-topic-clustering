639,1096,True,2020,"Modernly built, lots of free parking spaces, a coffee bar and friendly staff. Unfortunately, in my opinion, the shopping experience is not there because the prices are relatively high despite the outlet! The division and presentation is also not necessarily sensible or comprehensible! But all in all good"
640,1548,True,2018,"Large selection, lots of bargains too. Sometimes you have to search for something to find something that suits you. The shops in the area also have very good prices. Staff friendly and helpful. There are enough cash registers. I rarely had to wait long."

Unfortunately, the offer was only sparse in the correct men's sizes, i.e. XXL. ‚Ä¶"
646,915,True,2023,"Many of the reviews describe the Factory Outlet, which is across the street and does indeed have special offers. The brand store is actually a normal store with normal prices (as far as I could see) and the current collection. ‚Ä¶"

The employees in the shop were also very helpful and very friendly. Without being intrusive. ‚Ä¶"
652,315,True,2023,Overpriced and hardly a bargain. After researching online you can find better deals elsewhere
653,392,True,2021,"We go there once a year to buy shoes and sports equipment for the children. We always find something and some of the prices are really great. The Corona sales regulations are also being implemented well. However, you should book a shopping slot in advance otherwise you will be waiting in line for around 1.5 hours."

657,1794,False,2019,"Large selection, but you have to look for ‚Äúreal bargains‚Äù here. The prices felt like they were barely below normal retail prices. If you're there anyway, just go there. But in my opinion it's not worth planning an outlet weekend specifically for this."
658,1212,True,2022,"Quite crowded, even on weekdays at lunchtime there are long queues at the checkout. Selection is OK but not exceptional. The offer is very manageable for children."
659,1117,False,2023,"The store is great and the staff is very friendly - although this year there is no FC Bayern Munich third jersey, even though your headquarters are next door.

663,745,True,2017,Huge selection and yet nothing there! I was there twice because the outlet was on the way - it's not worth consciously driving there. The price advantage is marginal to non-existent. There is a lot of goods available and generally well ‚Ä¶

665,1261,False,2021,"Well, in my opinion the store is overrated. Prices are okay. Choice not so much. Many products are the same, only the color changes and then the parts are distributed across half the store. Like other large companies, the name is marketed and people go along with it. Nobody leaves without having bought something."
666,127,True,2021,"1.5 hour waiting time because only 140 people are allowed in. Since it was still raining, the shopping mood was gone. The staff kindly handed out umbrellas üëç

669,25,True,2023,"Simply great and latest articles...with unfortunately not always expert staff, who appear to be interns and therefore specialist questions are not answered optimally"
670,188,True,2020,Outlet store with enough parking spaces. Not all sizes are always available. Some things can be found cheaper online. Very nice environment. Store looks very well maintained. Tip: Visit during the week...the early bird catches the worm.
671,723,True,2018,"Big selection at really good prices. You have to look for something, and you often find it. Empty spaces on the shelves are quickly filled. The parking situation is well solved by the free parking garage."
672,931,False,2022,"Good selection, reasonable prices and advice from specialist staff works well. ADIDAS quality is undisputed anyway. It's always fun if you want to shop cheaply (not cheaply) üëçüëçüëç ‚Ä¶"
673,982,True,2021,"If you're lucky you'll find bargains. But for clothing, the internet is cheaper than the 30% you get here.
I think the staff had a bad day when I was there.
I will never go there voluntarily again."
674,1630,False,2023,"As with the last visits, thanks to Adidas for the opportunity to park/spend the night here with your motorhome. Of course our son also found one or two things in your store!"
675,1088,True,2018,"I don't think the trip is really worth it if you want to save money. The discounted items are mostly available in sizes that 0.1% of the world's population wears. The small shop has the latest trends, but you don't save money compared to ‚Ä¶"

680,225,False,2022,"Selection no reason to go. No common sizes. What used to fit is apparently no longer wearable, at least for me, thanks to new cuts"
681,1802,True,2023,Good selection and sometimes good offers (but not necessarily!)
682,1376,True,2023,My favorite outlet!!! You will always find good prices and offers!
683,566,True,2022,"Prices are nothing special.
You can even get the items cheaper online.
Only sales or discount campaigns are interesting. Then you have to be lucky to get items in the usual sizes."
684,979,True,2022,"After queuing for an hour, good prices as usual. We mainly get children's things here. For us, a sports shoe or sneaker is more likely to fall off. But it really depends on what is currently on the shelf."
685,874,False,2023,The goods offered are average and nothing exceptional. I couldn't find anything for myself in the store.
686,764,False,2023,"Outlet with a very large selection (on 2 levels). Above all, there is a large selection of shoes and there is also a large selection for the little ones."
687,1132,True,2019,"Nice big store, but that's about it. Selection prices rather mediocre. If you're nearby you can take a look, but it's not worth going there specifically."

693,1143,True,2023,The photo is of my wife's foot after she wore a new Terrex running shoe for about 30 minutes. Which is due to absolutely inadequate advice. The supposed ‚Äúspecialist salespeople‚Äù in the small shop just ask what surface you mainly run on and ‚Ä¶

698,1164,True,2021,"Due to Corona, only 120 people are allowed in the store at the same time; so you have to wait in line to get in. When you ask, you'll find out inside that all changing rooms are closed ""for hygiene reasons"". ‚Ä¶"
699,986,False,2022,"Huge selection, especially when it comes to shoes, but not a place for special bargains. Anyone who knows the prices from the online shop and uses various voucher codes for their orders is in many cases better off online. ‚Ä¶"
700,160,False,2022,The clerk at the checkout was unable to properly load the purchased voucher. It could then not be redeemed and the blame then fell on us. The customer service was bad. No courtesy or customer service whatsoever.
701,430,True,2020,"Nice, modern store, clear... goods were priced incorrectly! At the checkout they charged more than what was stated on the sign.
This happened to us again about 2 hours apart with the same article. ‚Ä¶"

Lots of choice (women, men, children)... We found what we were looking for again üëç ‚Ä¶"
709,631,False,2023,Made a few snaps again. Important!! You shouldn't go there with specific wishes. But there are always random bargains.
710,1734,True,2022,Not worth visiting! No really cheaper clothing. You can also get the items from ‚Äúnormal‚Äù retailers with slight discounts. The sizes stop at XL! Standard sizes are also often out of stock - there are plenty of XS! As if Adidas only supports short athletes... so it's a failure for people over 1.90m!
711,583,False,2023,"The Herzo Outlets are always worth a visit for shopping! But you have to be lucky to find the right one in your size, it's worth browsing!"
712,978,True,2023,Well sorted. Of course not all sizes of every item are always available. It's just an outed store.

723,746,False,2023,I have a question about the inner material of the sneakers in general. Why is such poor quality material used? That's why I need three pairs of shoes a year because the material on the Achilles tendon wears out very quickly...
724,471,False,2024,Best shoes in a long time...
725,662,False,2019,"The outlet is now the last remaining ramp.
The shoe selection in particular is a disaster and you can get the rest online for at least the same price."
726,2105,True,2023,"Unfortunately, there are hardly any bargains to be found anymore. I also think I‚Äôm more likely to be in Ukraine than in Germany. The majority of the saleswomen are Ukrainians who cannot speak German. Very unprofessional from adidas!!!"
727,411,True,2019,"Despite the ""outlet"" it's still relatively expensive. The only bonus: the selection is much larger than in normal stores, but you still miss things for different sports. The staff seem nice but don't seem to have much of a clue themselves."

735,294,False,2021,"The selection for women from size 42 is very poor, which annoyed me because there are large sizes for men. Otherwise, the employees we spoke to were very nice and the hygiene concept was OK. But there were already a lot of people inside."
736,793,False,2022,"Very disappointing customer service. We are not responsible for products sold under the brand but not adidas. But this wasn't made clear at the time of purchase. I will stay away from this brand in the future. Tonality not as bad as at Commerzbank, but very arrogant. The customer left the money and unfortunately that was it."
737,404,True,2020,"Shit. Goods awarded at 19.95. I should pay 32 euros. Ask for information about this. Well... mistakes can happen. Yes, no, of course. This is how you can also earn money. Legally it is paid as it is excellent. They didn't address it."
738,2134,False,2023,"Bought soccer shoes but the salesman didn't have much knowledge about the shoes and size advice, preferred to play with a ball in his hand!"
739,487,False,2022,"Thanks to Corona, we had to wait in line for a long time to get into the store. Mostly just small sizes. XS, S. From size L onwards, almost nothing. Not worth going if you're tall and female... It was very disappointing"
740,1192,True,2021,Waited in line for half an hour to get in. Unfortunately they have closed the children's corner - incomprehensible because playgrounds are also open... you could close every second place... but the main thing is a hygiene concept... but annoying for parents!

742,2133,False,2019,We were here for the first time today. Lots of free parking spaces available. We got a lot of bargains. There was also an additional 25% if you bought more than 4 items and that shouldn't be difficult in this outlet. ‚Ä¶

746,585,True,2022,"You buy expensive running shoes for a friend and the seller says that if they don't fit, he can hand them over to anyone from Adidas - making this statement just to sell the shoe is a shame because it wasn't correct We had to drive 3 hours ‚Ä¶"
747,1057,True,2020,"Depending on what you're looking for, it's becoming increasingly rare to find bargains. The prices are rather normal. People often become more resourceful online. Many discount campaigns for unions or fire departments, for example, have been discontinued. So it's a sports clothing wholesale market with random shoppers."
748,2155,True,2019,"Very nice models, a bit expensive..."
749,1200,True,2021,The prices were quite reasonable for an outlet. The employees we spoke to were all very nice and accommodating. The waiting time in line in front of the store (due to Corona) was about 20 minutes on a Saturday afternoon.

754,1427,True,2018,Absolutely awesome store. There's really nothing more that can be said about this. Staff is super nice and helpful. Prices are really really good. A hell of a lot of stuff to choose from. Craziness
755,287,True,2019,"In my opinion a typical outlet. I wouldn't go there specifically, but just make a detour if you're in the area. I made a snapper, otherwise the selection was okay and not really cheap either. Can be done, does not have to be."
756,2078,True,2019,"If you have children who are growing up, it's really great because cheap jerseys, soccer shoes, indoor shoes and casual shoes are also available. (You need new ones every year). For adults, I thought it was nice that if you were nearby, ‚Ä¶"

773,1359,True,2023,It's sad that there are stores in Germany where I'm not allowed to enter with my dog. Adidas should actually be aware that they don't sell food.

781,190,True,2017,"It has now subsided somewhat after the renovation. In the past, you could use your employee card to go to a separate area at the top and get all the new collections at a reduced price. Today, since the renovation, it has become more of an ‚Ä¶"

Keep it up üëçüëç. ‚Ä¶"
784,937,False,2023,"Lots of new products! Top!
We had a complaint, took another product with us and the difference was paid out onto a credit card (you can redeem it anywhere at Adidas). Top!"
785,789,True,2023,"Small shop with a small selection of current sportswear. Unfortunately with a very small selection, I was hoping to get the current Schittlanf jersey during the World Cup... ‚Ä¶"
786,168,True,2020,"Good prices and large selection. Very nice and helpful staff! Shopping is fun there. You can still shop there in the morning, but later it gets very crowded"
787,1804,True,2023,I was there for the third time now and couldn't find anything suitable.
788,1803,True,2020,"It gets more and more disappointing every time. You used to be able to get real bargains. Since the renovation of the upper floor and the shop across the street. It's no longer worth the journey. For the most part, you pay less for shoe models and clothing at local retailers than you do here."
789,484,True,2023,"If you're lucky you'll find good parts or even a snapper, but you don't have to expect anything out of the ordinary.
But there is a wide selection of sports clothing.
Unfortunately, ‚ÄúAdidas Originals‚Äù are in short supply."
790,834,True,2019,"Lots of cool and affordable bargains! The journey there is worth it! Quality is and remains quality! Even if it's a slightly larger sum, it's worth it! I've never regretted it! Keep it up!"
791,1208,True,2021,"Great deals on soccer shoes! We've always found what we're looking for several times so far. Due to Corona, shopping is even more relaxed because entry is limited. We wait 10 minutes to get in. Were there around 2:00 p.m."
792,1329,True,2021,"The staff is very friendly. It is a very large Adidas shop which means there is a lot to choose from. Despite the size, you can always find an employee who can help you. The checkouts are wide enough that you can put your purchases down if you have to wait"
793,1748,False,2022,"If you don't need anything specific, you can get a bargain or two. If you are looking for a specific product, e.g. a specific model of running shoe, you have to be lucky that one is available in the size you want and you shouldn't be picky, ‚Ä¶"
794,1998,False,2020,"Great store, you're sure to find something. When we pass by nearby, we always stop by. Staff is very friendly. Can be recommended with a clear conscience."
795,2046,True,2019,"They already have some cool stuff! Every now and then I'll be nearby and take a look. I've never been able to get out without buying something. Definitely worth a visit. If you go during the week, shopping is more relaxed than Friday/Saturday. The staff have always been well looked after and are very helpful and nice."
796,1290,True,2020,"Clear, large area with many affordable offers. Clean and well lit. There are also enough large sizes available. There is something for every budget and taste."
797,836,False,2022,Great purchase with great discounts
798,105,True,2019,"I was a little disappointed...the offers were ok, nothing more. There were hardly any shoes in my size (45) and the T-shirts and sweaters didn't blow me away either...they were more of the less attractive kind. However, the free and plentiful parking spaces are positive."
799,1502,True,2023,Today was the last time I was here. Why ? Dogs are prohibited in this Adidas textile outlet!!! In 2021 our Bolonka was allowed into the shop!! Please explain the background to me!! (and that at 39 degrees)
800,611,False,2023,"Compared to previous years, both the friendliness of the salespeople and the ‚Äúoffers‚Äù have decreased significantly. A visit to your local sports store is now more fun."
801,1581,True,2020,"I liked it because the place is spacious and you can get acquainted with many models from Adidas. What I didn‚Äôt like is that the prices are a little high, I wouldn‚Äôt say that these are outlet prices... since the same model can be bought on the Internet for less."
802,206,False,2022,"As a sports-loving family, this is of course a permanent excursion point on the Frankentour agenda. There is an outlet store and opposite the concept store with current goods. We were there on a Monday morning outside of the Bavarian ‚Ä¶"
803,725,True,2023,I was surprised that everything Adidas offers is available here. Even Adilettes in all colors. And you can get lots of bargains. So we really liked it here.

805,1585,True,2023,Very large outlet with a huge selection of shoes. Unfortunately very crowded on Saturday afternoon.
806,647,True,2020,"If you are in the area, the sturgeon is definitely a worthwhile destination. Large selection, (usually) low prices and real bargains are possible outside in the tent. For us, the trip from Nuremberg was worth it."
807,1230,True,2022,"Brand Store, is good... Outlet, considering that it is at its birth, a little bit. I think you can find more and better quality in the other outlets. Despite everything, full stars... because the brand store and the friendliness of the ""staff crew"" pulled it out."
808,1567,True,2019,"The store is quite large and spacious. Here you will not have to crowd among many people. I was surprised by the large number of fitting rooms. There are many questions about the assortment of products.. the number of sizes is very limited, ‚Ä¶"
809,942,False,2022,"This store is totally overrated. It looks chic, but you can't find any bargains here or in the right size. More like selling leftovers. And when I found a sweat shirt in Czech Asian market quality at an Adidas price, I said to myself never again. Things are more pleasant with the competitor a few corners away."
810,1558,False,2020,"Every now and then I got hold of a sample item, otherwise goods like in any store and no real bargains... that was mass tourism meets mass-produced goods. I think it's only worth it if you want to save a few euros on the current product."
811,1046,False,2023,"As the name suggests, you can find the current collections in the brand store, so you can't expect the new DFB jersey, for example, to be a bargain like some people write here. To do this you have to go to the Adidas outlet opposite, where you can get the older collections from various clubs."
812,435,False,2018,"If I could give 0 stars, it would be 0. My rating is not based on the staff, but on the structure and presentation of the clothes. I've been here to the outlet several times. But now I can and will save myself the trip here."
813,1935,True,2019,You have to be careful what the parts cost ‚Äúoutside‚Äù and here. Not everything is cheap. And you shouldn't rely on having clothes over size XXL. Disappearingly small selection.
814,200,False,2018,"We went Saturday, holiday, after Good Friday and it was a pleasant shopping. Of course there was a lot going on, but you could still shop well, it was pleasant. The selection is really great, if you don't find anything, it's your own fault. ‚Ä¶"
815,1781,False,2020,"Pleasant shopping, very friendly staff. The lady in the bistro deserves the highest praise! Confidently, with composure, friendliness and warmth, he ran the place all by himself, respect! It was also delicious!"

Great ambience, mega brand, nice colleagues and top quality of the goods...!!!! Simply brilliant, look and drink
Many pleasures"
817,1932,False,2023,We all drove from Munich to Herzogenaurach to shop at Adidas. Great thing.

819,1095,True,2019,"Good parking in the parking garage, the shop is large but not as huge as it looks from the outside. If you need XXL as a size (like me) you will be rather disappointed with the selection. Found 7 pieces in XXL in the outlet....sad. I liked ‚Ä¶"
820,708,True,2021,"Unfortunately, queuing at the entrance is not optimally solved. The end of the queue cannot be seen and if there is a lot of traffic, entry tickets could be issued. I won't be back any time soon."
821,362,True,2019,You can get some bargains. Large selection. Staff very nice. Cashier totally unfriendly.
822,1529,False,2019,Very good quality and large selection at top prices. The staff is also very friendly and competent. Can only be recommended.

I feel really good
Take a good look ‚Ä¶"
824,1399,True,2020,"A large building full of discounted Adidas items. Some items are offered for women, men and children, such as sportswear, shoes and accessories. The cloakrooms are easily accessible and there are enough of them so you don't have to wait ‚Ä¶"
825,1416,True,2023,I thought the prices were still quite high and most of the shoes weren't available in all sizes
826,1920,False,2019,Good sorting. There are also sales offers. Price performance is right. But here too you should compare. Thirst and a little hunger are also taken care of.
827,1247,True,2019,"Oh my god...what a narrow and confusing parking garage. Really now? Not a burner as a business card and ‚Äúfirst impression‚Äù maker. The store is large and clear. The range of clothing on offer is also ‚Äúclear‚Äù, especially as the impression ‚Ä¶"
828,1435,True,2022,"Very large selection of clothing for young and old in all sizes.
If you're in the area you should definitely take a look."
829,1525,True,2018,"There is virtually no consultation.
The range appears to consist of goods that were slow-moving elsewhere.
Except for the shoes, the selection is mediocre for such a large store. ‚Ä¶"
830,259,True,2020,"Great service, thanks to the best seller above!"
831,24,True,2019,It was very loud and also crowded. Before that we went to Puma where it was a thousand times nicer and more pleasant to shop. Otherwise quite nice and no long waiting times as there are many cash registers.
832,531,True,2023,Nice shopping you can get some bargains
833,1049,True,2023,"Lots of choice, free parking."
834,1741,True,2024,Just exceptionally good. The staff is consistently very friendly and extremely helpful. Professionals through and through!
835,827,True,2019,"Quite ok... everything is packed, so the order leaves a lot to be desired... the staff, especially in the outlet store, are almost overwhelmed by the rush. Finding real bargains is difficult. If only for shoes that are only occasionally in ‚Ä¶"
836,516,True,2018,"Large store with a collection for different sports. But there are a limited number of racks where big discounts are offered. It is wise to check the special offer days in advance. On Crazy Tuesdays, for example: 25% extra discount given."
837,936,True,2021,"Very nice selection. Unfortunately, I wanted more unusual items from the sale products. Otherwise everything was great"
838,1925,True,2023,Large selection unfortunately only 10% cheaper than in other outlet stores
839,1011,True,2019,"I don't even know where to start, but let's start with the parking because it's great. The adjacent parking garage offers an incredible amount of space and you don't have to walk far to the entrance. When you get there you are first ‚Ä¶"
840,527,True,2024,"Good selection, great prices.
I like cotton t-shirts and sweatpants.
There is a selection of light, comfortable sneakers for summer and for the gym. I recently bought some great white sneakers for outdoor activities."
841,1796,True,2019,I bought my golf shoes here! Great offers and great selection! I wasn't interested in finding a bargain but rather in having as wide a selection as possible and that's what I had! The service was very nice and that's why it's 5 stars!
842,1468,False,2024,Very nice staff
843,1982,True,2023,"Brand store exactly opposite the outlet store. A few offers, otherwise current range. The flocking of jerseys is also done here on site."
844,329,True,2019,"There are absolutely enough parking spaces available, everyone will find their place. In the outlet itself you will receive good advice from the staff and they will help wherever they can. The selection is really big and you save money. Definitely worth a visit."
845,319,False,2022,"You come with high expectations and are disappointed! I've been wearing Adidas shoes for many years and I'm size 42. Here in the outlet my feet have shrunk to 39-40 and yet they didn't fit properly, very strange ü§® save yourself the trip and buy them regularly! ‚Ä¶"
846,248,True,2019,"A huge selection of sports clothing and sports shoes (in all sizes, I've never seen shoes this big). The audience is international and the staff is very friendly. A great store. A fan family could be equipped here relatively cheaply."
847,1874,True,2018,pretty big and some good prices. But with standard sizes it becomes difficult to find THE bargain. Unfortunately an item was broken the day after purchase. To date I have not received a response from Adidas to my email. Not good.
848,1512,True,2019,"I had promised more...
I was somehow expecting more.
The selection is larger than in a sports store, but I couldn't get what I was ‚Ä¶"
849,1379,False,2020,For me it has nothing to do with an outlet. It's just big business. Prices are far too high for an outlet. I can also buy it in the normal store and save myself the journey by car.
850,1349,True,2018,"You can get good bargains here if you're a bit lucky.
There is a really wide range, if not the entire Adidas range.
However, you have to find someone for advice, but that wasn't a problem for me."
851,852,True,2019,"When we visited the Adidas outlet we were rather disappointed. Our expectations were probably too high. The selection was significantly smaller than expected. ‚ÄúNormal‚Äù clothing for everyday life, which is also available from Adidas, was ‚Ä¶"

853,1039,True,2019,"I don't find it particularly breathtaking there. The prices aren't that low at all. Every now and then you'll find a bargain, but most things are still expensive."
854,951,True,2023,"Great selection + reasonable prices.
What more could you want?"
855,949,True,2022,You can also get bargains here. There is a huge selection of Adidas items. Nice and motivated service workers. There is a McDonald's right next door. There are a lot of parking spaces.
856,1044,True,2021,Pleasant shopping experience! There are many types of products. Very good quality brand. The staff is also very friendly! It is also Adidas‚Äô largest outlet! Don‚Äôt miss it!
857,497,True,2024,Good shopping
858,2151,True,2020,"Ok location, big exhibition space. A large selection of products, but the price is not as reduced as advertised. The biggest crowd was in the tent where the last quantities of products were sold. The price went up to 75% lower!"
859,1611,True,2018,"It's great when there are sales. I picked up some cool shoes and jogging pants at a great price (‚Ç¨25 each). It was my first time there and I was lucky that there were fat percentages, even on items that had already been marked down.
Big store with lots of clothes. You should visit if you have the opportunity."
860,628,True,2019,"If you specifically need something, you can get a bargain. Nicely decorated. But somehow it still doesn't blow me away"

862,244,False,2022,"Price performance perfect, the staff is professional and courteous... It's great that we have something like this close to us."
863,563,False,2020,"It's just great there, there are so many things you can buy there. There is a 1 star deduction because they don't have the original flocking for my jersey. A bit of a shame but otherwise great"
864,337,False,2023,In my opinion it's not worth it if you want to buy cheaply
865,175,True,2023,Were a little disappointed with the selection of running shoes and clothing. Otherwise well sorted
866,558,True,2018,"Unfortunately it's often very busy. The store looks chaotic. If you are looking for something specific, you get the impression that the products are randomly scattered all over the store. ‚Ä¶"
867,1335,True,2023,Great selection at good prices. I will gladly come again.
868,1761,True,2017,"We have a problem!
My son has very wide feet!
It is very difficult to buy shoes for him. ‚Ä¶"
869,1568,True,2023,Annual family outing with a difference. Once again we got a bargain or two.
870,569,True,2023,"Cool shop, great stuff and the prices are right too."
871,1392,False,2023,"Great selection, prices like any outlet."
872,464,False,2020,"They had plenty of adult clothes to choose from. Unfortunately there wasn't much choice for children and toddlers. But what they had for the kids was great. Price-wise, everything was okay too."
873,264,True,2020,"Anyone who needs XL has bad cards here.
There are either trousers or jackets, but both can only be found in very rare cases. Admittedly, L is quite large here, but that doesn't apply to all items. However, if you need size M or S (as a man), you have a good selection."
874,559,True,2019,"Unfortunately, in my opinion, there is very little selection of interesting items and it is always overcrowded.
The pricing is okay for a factory store, but you can usually get it cheaper online."
875,1246,True,2019,"The store is a bit confusing, but the selection is unbeatable. If you have any questions, the numerous, motivated employees will help you in a friendly manner.
It couldn't be better üëç ‚Ä¶"
876,1697,True,2022,"You have to be there all the time, the range changes often, it is an outlet that sells a lot of returns at good prices. But there are also new products. You always find something."
877,243,True,2020,"Top equipped. There can be lots of great bargains. Otherwise, like everywhere else, typical outlet goods.
It's better to inquire about promotions before you go a long way."
878,427,True,2021,"Large but limited selection. In my opinion, most of the items are clearance items or special outlet items. Savings usually at least 30%. But in individual cases it can also be much higher. Common sizes are often not included - regardless of ‚Ä¶"

883,776,True,2021,Holiday season... lots of things going on! Long queues at the entrance... but it was still quick and of course you could find something. 30/33% is nothing to sneeze at
884,638,True,2020,"very crowded, little advice, few but very friendly and helpful employees. Considering that it is a Franconian company, the structure is far too American for me and many things such as: Changing rooms labeled with American names. ‚Ä¶"
885,46,True,2023,"The promotions are very worthwhile, but it is not easy to find what you want within the promotions."
886,378,True,2023,There are real bargains to be had here and there.
887,2041,True,2017,"Here you can get Adidas sportswear at reasonable prices.
No real factory sales because production takes place in low-wage countries.
The employees are super friendly and well trained. ‚Ä¶"
888,818,True,2019,"Large location with a decent selection. Some Reebok stuff too. Priced between 30% and 50% below list price. However, the usual sizes of shoes are often out of stock. If you pass here on the A3, just take the short detour. It's only about a 5 minute drive."
889,664,True,2018,"We were there on Saturday, right when it opened at 9am. The influx of people willing to buy is huge, but the outlet is very spacious with wide streets so that you don't step on anyone's toes. Currently sale of 20-50% additional on the ‚Ä¶"
890,941,True,2019,"Huge outlet. You have to take the time and you'll find some bargains. Additional promotions obviously take place on a regular basis. However, you have to look for longer sizes."

Finally shopping again and then being served with so much friendliness and very good advice, whether shoes or clothing - it was a competent and helpful service. ‚Ä¶"
892,1873,True,2019,"An absolute ""MUST"" for an Adidas fan/friend. There are a lot of parking spaces available, both shaded and sunny. Parking garage with 2 levels etc. Very large area and lots of choice. Bargain hunters will be more than happy in this outlet. ‚Ä¶"
893,1738,True,2023,"Nicely done. But if you're looking for a bargain, you've come to the wrong place. Goods from the previous year are reduced slightly below the RRP."
894,1047,True,2022,"I was particularly disappointed that there were no football boots from the current collection there. And if they were available, they were of a size that only a few people could wear."
895,844,True,2020,"Anyone traveling in the greater Nuremberg area should definitely take a detour to Herzogenaurach, it's worth it. There are enough parking spaces available. If you feel hungry after shopping, a McDonald's is within walking distance. There is ‚Ä¶"
896,648,True,2022,"You'll basically be ""killed"" by the offer here! But great! You simply have to have been there."
897,1860,True,2019,I was totally disappointed! The prices are not cheaper! There is a large selection... but just as expensive as normal... and there is a bargain stand in every sports store
898,1633,True,2023,"Very great offers!
Friendly staff and plenty of space to browse."
899,1210,True,2021,"Nice, nothing more. There used to be real bargains here every now and then, but unfortunately not anymore.
I'd rather drive 500m further..."
900,881,False,2022,"For tall people, women 185 cm, men 207 cm, there is nothing left. Why is size TXL no longer available? Is adidas also part of the industry that prefers to sell XL and neglect people for a long time?"

902,147,True,2024,Interesting clothes

904,69,True,2019,"Incredibly crowded, which is probably normal for a Saturday. There were no sellers to be found, and if there were, the poorest people were surrounded by at least 5 customers. When it comes to shoes, it looks like a bazaar, there are about ‚Ä¶"
905,1635,True,2020,"Highly Recommended! Some really amazing prices in a positive sense. We were there very early, so it was still pleasant for shopping."
906,1455,False,2022,"Anyone who pays more elsewhere is their own fault. If you know someone on the staff, ask and they'll definitely take you along. Then there are special discounts and then the price is actually good. Otherwise I think Adidas is overpriced."
907,785,True,2019,"Very large selection and usually in all sizes, but these are only the models that are being phased out. The prices are approximately 20-25% below the retail price. The current collection is across the street."
908,1881,False,2022,"Apart from the queue to enter, ok. And one more note: in the store on the ground floor, there is a mix of women's and men's displays, it's hard to make out the gender ü§î ‚Ä¶"

911,290,True,2019,"Large selection of new items, but for me with a shoe size of 49.5 or US 15 there was no shoe-wise selection, but that's what you get in most stores with that size. The waitresses were all friendly, you were greeted and asked directly if you could help. Nice atmosphere. Gladly again."
912,470,True,2020,Great bargains sometimes you just have to hold back a bit with your purchases because you can easily get a certain added value for your money
913,1397,True,2020,Good prices but this time the ‚Äúoutdoor‚Äù section for men was completely missing. Many changing rooms closed. Very crowded (Saturday).
914,510,False,2021,"The staff was friendly and the store was clean and tidy, unfortunately the price for most of the products is no longer really worth the long journey for us."
915,114,False,2018,I was at Adidas for a long time and spent a lot of money on all my family members. I spent almost ‚Ç¨300. And the supposed ‚Äúlady‚Äù Ms. S.

916,593,True,2021,"We were passing through and also stopped at Adidas.

There is a great selection in all areas. In my opinion the prices could be a little lower for a brand store at the headquarters!"
917,381,True,2020,"One star is still too many! For years I have bought sporting goods, primarily sneakers, for many thousands of euros on adidas.de. The support is unreasonable - an impudence for a company that sells itself so expensively. Typically - have it ‚Ä¶"

1076,58,True,2020,disappointing. Hardly any choice of different sizes and the price is even more expensive than some on the Internet. Traveling from Nuremberg is no longer worth it for me!
1077,694,True,2022,"Why doesn't it say on the Internet that you have to wait in line... if you want to wait for hours, you're welcome to come... We'll never come like this again!"

1097,965,False,2018,"Large selection of discounted branded items in a very spacious and architecturally interesting building. Large parking garage directly opposite. Anyone who comes to Herzogenaurach should visit the adidas store and, conversely, after the store it is worth visiting the historic old town."
1098,991,False,2022,The offers are varied and the shoes are in good quality. But the types of basketball shoes are not much. Usually you can have a discount price.

1150,1107,True,2020,"Unfortunately there are not enough sizes available, especially for the heart of Adidas I personally would have expected more (many things only up to size M :-(), the Outlet City Metzingen sometimes has more selection at better prices. ‚Ä¶"
1151,1219,True,2019,"Of course there are a few offers but all in all it's nothing different than what you'd find in other Adidas shops in other outlet centers. On the contrary. There are sometimes more and better bargains... Roermond or Ochtrup, for example. ‚Ä¶"

1154,798,False,2021,I expected more from Adidas. More cheaper offers. I've been going there for years and have enjoyed it. During the Corona crisis there are almost no offers that are worthwhile.

1156,1154,True,2022,Store quite good. It is rare to find employees. But 1 employee for the entire shoe department is also a bit lean.
1157,233,True,2021,"Overall, uninteresting. Since Adidas clothing can now be bought everywhere, sometimes even cheaper, the trip to Herzogenaurach is actually no longer worth it."
1158,1182,True,2023,"There aren't really any real snappers anymore, prices are almost like normal"
1159,156,True,2019,"Surprisingly well-stocked outlet. Large with a nice coffee bar.
Here you will find what you are looking for. Whether they are bargains is debatable."

Funny for men there are large sizes."

1271,302,False,2018,It's not worth going. Selection (e.g. of football shoes) is poor. The really good models are not available. And everything you get in the outlet can also be ordered for a cheaper price in any online shop.
